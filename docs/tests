Im trying to improve the quality of pommo by creating automatic tests that can
tell us when we break something.
I am putting this tests in the "tests" folder in the Pommo root dir. If you are
an end user you can erase that folder without worries.

I am using phpunit for the tests, so if you want to run them you will need to
instal it.
